# Q3: Word and Color Pattern Matching

## Overview
This project is a Bash script-based word game that involves matching words with color patterns. Users input a five-letter word and a color pattern comprising Green (G), Yellow (Y), and Silver (S), and the script evaluates words from words.txt against these inputs.

## Features
- Interactive script for user input of word and color pattern.
- Logic to compare words from a list against user inputs using the specified color pattern.
- Case-insensitive word matching.
- Comprehensive testing scenarios to ensure functionality.

## Installation and Usage
2. Run the script: `./q3.sh`.
3. Follow the prompts to input a word and a color pattern.
4. The script will output matching words from the list based on the pattern.

## How It Works
- `G` in the pattern indicates the letter in that position must match exactly.
- `Y` indicates the letter must be present elsewhere in the word.
- `S` means the letter should not exist in the word.


## Data
- words.txt
